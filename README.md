# DMOJ & LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my competitive programming solutions for problems from **LeetCode**, **DMOJ**, and **Codeforces**.

It serves as a personal archive of **accepted submissions**, primarily written in **Python**, and is used for reference, practice, and tracking my progress as I improve my problem-solving and algorithmic skills.

## Contents
- Python solutions to competitive programming problems  
- Problems from LeetCode (primary focus), DMOJ, and Codeforces  
- Code submitted directly to the respective platforms  
- Miscellaneous solutions from other problem-solving platforms (if added)

## Notes
- All solutions are written for learning and practice  
- Problem statements are not included  
- Code reflects submissions as they were accepted and may not be optimized further
